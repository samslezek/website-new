		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img style='width:170px; padding:10px' src='https://i.imgur.com/GtpN14A.jpg'></img>
		<p>I'm Sam. I live in San Francisco and work in Strategy at Instacart. In my free time, I play basketball and soccer, listen to EDM, and explore California and beyond. Here I'm playing around with a couple of little music projects :)</p>
    <p>(Please don't judge the very imperfect formatting. I've made the decision not to dive too deep into the weeds of any pure front-end libraries until applicable to a larger project - for now I'm just hacking around with Bootstrap.)</p>
